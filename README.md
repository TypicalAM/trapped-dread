# Trapped Dread

ULTRAKILL Level 0-S Replica

## Description

This project is a replica of the Level 0-S from the game ULTRAKILL, implemented using C++ and OpenGL. ULTRAKILL is a fast-paced first-person shooter game with retro-style graphics and intense action. The Level 0-S is known for its chilling gameplay and unique design, and this project aims to recreate that experience. This project was made as a part of a course "Computer Graphics and Visualisation".
